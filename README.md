# natural_care-vibes
This project aims to target online business in sales, similar to shopify. An eCommerce store for skin care.

# Work in progress
**P.S.** - I am currently working on this project.

Due to the recent news of updates to the Next.Js ecosystem, I have decided to give the project a day or two to get up to speed with the latest features.

I intend to continue to update the project as I learn more about Next.Js and the ecosystem.
